------------------

  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed an index out bounds bug in drag code.
  
  - Fixed an index out bounds bug in LookAndFeel theme.

1.5.0 - 2007-01-31
------------------

  New features:

  - TitledTab can now be enabled/disabled using the ENABLED 
    property in the TitledTabProperties for the tab. The method 
    TitledTab.setEnabled(...) will modify the property.



1.4.0 - 2005-12-04
------------------

  New Features:
  
  - New experimental theme called LookAndFeelTheme that tries 
    to replicate the JTabbedPane's look using the active look 
    and feel. This theme may or may not work depending on your 
    look and feel(!)

  - API change(!). The background color set to null in 
    ComponentProperties no longer controls the opaque parameter 
    of a component. Use the setOpaque(...) in the 
    ShapedPanelProperties for that component instead. All the 
    included themes have been updated but it may affect other 
    themes.
    
  - Added TabAreaVisiblePolicy and TabAreaVisiblePolicyProperty 
    that makes it possible to specify visibility policy i.e. 
    when the tab area should be visible. There are 4 policies, 
    ALWAYS, NEVER, TABS_EXIT and MORE_THAN_ONE_TAB. Also added 
    TabbedPanel.isTabAreaVisible().
    
  - Added TabbedPanel.scrollTabToVisibleArea(Tab) that scrolls 
    the given tab into the visible part of the tab area.
  
  - Major optimization of TabbedPanel and TitledTab. Increased 
    performance when adding/removing tabs, updating properties 
    and mouse hovering.
    
  - Added new hover policy called ALWAYS_AND_EXCLUDE. It's the 
    same as policy ALWAYS but the TabbedPanel will be excluded 
    by other TabbedPanels when their hover policies are evaluated.
    
  - Added possibility to disable the TitledTab's focus marker, 
    see FOCUS_MARKER_ENABLED property in TitledTabProperties.
  
  - Added new TabbedPanel constructor that makes it possbile to 
    choose if a custom content area should use the content area 
    properties or not.
    
  - TabContentPanel can now be constructed and the TabbedPanel 
    set at a later time.
  
  
  Fixed bugs:
  
  - Sometimes the tab drop down list button was shown even if it 
    shouldn't be shown.
  
  - The right (or down) scroll button wasn't always enabled when 
    tabs were scrolled out to the right (or down).
  
  - TabbedPanel now uses a tab area component's preferred size 
    when laying out component in the tab area.

  - Classic theme now draws correct borders around tab area 
    components when the tab area orientation is down or left. 



1.3.0 - 2005-02-16
------------------

  New Features:
  
  - TitledTab now supports mouse hovering. It is possible to 
    specify a hover listener in the TitledTabProperties that will 
    be called when the tab is hovered by the mouse.
  
  - TabbedPanel supports mouse hovering. It is possible to specify 
    hover listeners for the entire tabbed panel, the tab area, the 
    tab area components area and the content area in the properties 
    objects. The hover policy can be changed using 
    TabbedPanelHoverPolicy in the TabbedPanelProperties.
    
  - TabbedPanelHoverAction is a convenient hover action that 
    implements the HoverListener interface and contains a 
    TabbedPanelProperties object that is automatically added 
    to/removed from (as super object) the hovered tabbed panel (or 
    any of its hovered areas). This makes it easy to modify 
    properties for a TabbedPanel or any of its areas when the 
    TabbedPanel is hovered by the mouse.
    
  - TitledTabHoverAction is a convenient hover action that implements 
    the HoverListener interface and contains a TitledTabProperties 
    object that is automatically added to/removed from (as super 
    object) the hovered titled tab. This makes it easy to modify 
    properties for a TitledTab when the tab is hovered by the mouse.
    
  - TitledTabDelayedMouseExitHoverAction wraps a HoverListener and 
    delays the hover listener's mouse exit when the TitledTab is no 
    longer hovered.
    
  - TabbedPanelTitledTabHoverAction is a hover action that is meant 
    to be used on a TabbedPanel (or any of its areas) an not on the 
    TitledTab. It makes it easy to change both TabbedPanelProperties 
    and TitledTabProperties when a TabbedPanel (or any of its areas) 
    is hovered by the mouse.
    
  - TitledTabTabbedPanelHoverAction is a hover action that is meant 
    to be used on a TitledTab and not on a TabbedPanel. It makes it 
    easy to change both TabbedPanelProperties for the TabbedPanel 
    that the TitledTab is memember of and the TitledTabProperties 
    for the TitledTab when the TitledTab is hovered by the mouse.
    
  - Added hasContentArea() function to tabbed panel that returns if 
    the tabbed panel has a content area or not.
    
  - Added possibility to remove a specific properties super object. 
    Developers should consider using removeSuperObject(...) instead 
    of removeSuperObject().
  
  - Holding down the shift key and then press/click/release/drag the 
    tab will not select the tab regardless of tab selection policy. 
    This makes it possible to reorder tabs without selecting or 
    highlighting them (just enable tab reordering and disable 
    highlight pressed tab so that the pressed tab is not highlighted 
    if it wasn't already highlighted).
  
  - It is now possible to customize the scroll buttons and the tab 
    drop down list button. You can assign your own buttons, change 
    the icon and set tool tip text. Each button (scroll 
    up/down/left/right and drop down list) has a seperate 
    ButtonProperties object. These objects are gathered in 
    TabbedPanelButtonProperties that is part of TabbedPanelProperties 
    and is retrieved by calling getButtonProperties() in the 
    TabbedPanelProperties.


  Fixed bugs:

  - Gtk look and feel now works, but the colors in tabs and tabbed 
    panels will be strange because almost no colors are set in the 
    UIManager by this look and feel.



1.2.0 - 2004-11-12
------------------

  - The commercial distribution is distributed under a slightly
    modified license, InfoNode Software License Version 1.1. The
    changes include a section about not being allowed to expose
    ITP functionality to external software components and
    a section that grants the licensee the right to obfuscate ITP
    together with a product.


  New Features:
  
  - Added a new theme called ShapedGradientTheme with support for 
    tabs with slopes on left and right side. 
  
  - Added weak listener support for PropertyMap's. See
    net.infonode.properties.propertymap.PropertyMapWeakListenerManager
    for more information.

  - Possible to assign shaped borders to the tab area, tab area 
    components area, content area and titled tab. Creating a border 
    using the ShapedBorder interface makes it possible to have 
    non-rectaungular shapes and create different looking titled tabs 
    by returning an java.awt.Shape. Events will only be triggered 
    inside of the shape.
    
  - New properties object called ShapedPanelProperties in 
    TabAreaProperties, TabAreaComponentProperties, 
    TabbedPanelContentPanelProperties and TitledTabStateProperties. 
    This makes it possible to specify component painters for painting 
    the background of the tab area, tab area components area, content 
    area and titled tab. If a shaped border is set, the painters 
    and/or background color will only be painted inside of the shape.
    
  - Added a new theme called ClassicTheme with TitledTabs with round 
    edges. Colors are taken from the current look and feel.
    
  - Added a new theme called SoftBlueIceTheme with round borders and 
    gradients as backgrounds.
  
  - Tab spacing can now be a negative value i.e. the tabs will 
    overlap. It's possible to specify the tab depth order i.e. 
    descending or ascending from the first tab. The highlighted tab 
    will always be displayed as the top most tab.
    
  - Default tab spacing is now -1 instead of 0.
    
  - TabLineBorder is now deprecated because of added support for 
    negative tab spacing. Consider using TabAreaLineBorder instead.


  Enhancements:

  - Gradient painter performance improvement.
  
  - OpenContentBorder now supports a color for the top and left line 
    and another color for the bottom and right lines
  

  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed a bug which caused a dragged Tab to be inserted first in the 
    TabbedPanel when it should be last.

  - Fixed so that gradient borders now can be alpha transparent.
    
  - Fixed TabbedPanel's preferred size because it was incorrect in some 
    cases.


1.1.0 - 2004-09-29
------------------

  - A source code example application called SimpleTabbedPanelExample
    can be found in "examples/net/infonode/tabbedpanel/example".  
    It shows how to create a tabbed panel, titled tabs, modify 
    properties and use themes. It is possible to compile and run the 
    example.


  New Features:

  - A tab is now by default selected on mouse press instead of mouse 
    release.
    
  - A new theme has been added, see GradientTheme. This theme paints
    gradient tab backgrounds and supports an opaque tab area.

  - A new tabbed panel property called PAINT_TAB_AREA_SHADOW has been
    added. Setting this to true will paint a continuous shadow for the
    tab area of a tabbed panel. Setting it to false paints a shadow
    for the highlighted tab and the tab area components panel.  

  - Improved shadow painting. Shadow is now painted for the tab area
    components panel as well.

  - When the tab area only contains one tab, the tab will be 
    compressed even if scrolling layout policy is activated

  - Added possibility to set a list of JComponents to be shown next 
    to the tabs in the tab area. The components are laid out in a 
    line with direction right or down depending on the tab area 
    orientation. Useful for adding buttons etc.

  - Added a tab drop down list button to the tab area.
    Makes it possible to show a combobox next to the tabs in the tab 
    area with a list of the tabs in the tabbed panel. Controlled by 
    a property.

  - Added tab select trigger property.
    Makes it possible to set if a tab is selected on mouse press or 
    release.

  - Set visible property for titled tab's text, icon and title 
    component. Possibility to hide and show the text, the icon and 
    the titled component even though they are set. 


  Fixed bugs:
  
  - Fixed a bug so that content area border is repainted when a tab is 
    selected without using a mouse.
    
  - Fixed a bug which caused tabs to be incorrectly rendered when 
    rotating the tab direction. The tab insets weren't correctly 
    rotated.
