History
=======

1.6.1 - 2009-02-24
------------------

  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed a bug which caused a line to be drawn under the selected 
    tab in the ShapedGradientTheme theme.



1.6.0 - 2009-02-05
------------------

  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed a bug that caused windows to be restored in the wrong
    index of a TabWindow.
    
  - Fixed a bug which caused tabs to be stored in incorrect order
    when writing a layout.
    
  - Fixed graphical performance issue with JRE 1.6u10.



1.5.0 - 2007-01-31
------------------

  New features:
  
  - Added possiblity to control the enabled/disabled state of a tab 
    by modifying the ENABLED property in the TitledTabProperties in 
    the TabProperties for a DockingWindow's tab. When the tab is 
    disabled, the DockingWindow cannot be selected.

  - In 1.4.0 a TabWindow no longer respected its child windows minimum 
    sizes. A new property called RESPECT_CHILD_WINDOW_MINIMUM_SIZE in 
    TabWindowProperties has been added that makes it possible to 
    configure this behaviour. The default value is false i.e. the  
    minimum sizes are not respected (as in 1.4.0). This will also work 
    for WindowBars.

  - FloatingWindows can now be created as JFrames instead of JDialogs
    using the property USE_FRAME in FloatingWindowProperties. Note that
    this property must be set before the FloatingWindow is created
    (typically in the default FloatingWindowProperties in the
    RootWindowProperties).


  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed a bug that caused the window tree not to be updated correctly
    when calling for example RootWindow.setWindow(). This could result
    in layouts being incorrectly written.

  - Fixed a bug which caused the size of deserialized FloatingWindows to be
    too large.
    
  - Fixed an issue with restoring a view to a TabWindow that has moved
    in the window tree.



1.4.0 - 2005-12-04
------------------

  New features:
  
  - A new DockingWindow called FloatingWindow has been added. 
    This is a window floating on top of the RootWindow and can be 
    moved anywhere on the screen. It's possible to drag windows 
    between a RootWindow and a FloatingWindow or a FloatingWindow 
    and a FloatingWindow. A window can also be maximized in a 
    FloatingWindow. Added createFloatingWindow() method to 
    RootWindow.
    
  - New experimental theme called LookAndFeelDockingTheme that tries 
    to replicate the look using the active look and feel. This theme 
    may or may not work depending on your look and feel(!)
    
  - API change(!). The background color set to null in 
    ComponentProperties no longer controls the opaque parameter of a 
    component. Use the setOpaque(...) in the ShapedPanelProperties 
    for that component instead. All the included themes have been 
    updated but it may affect other themes.
    
  - Added possibility to hide the tab in a TabWindow when it only 
    contains one tab. The tabs are automatically shown again when 
    there are more than one tab.
    
  - Added DropFilter and DropInfo (SplitDropInfo, ChildDropInfo, 
    InteriorDropInfo, InsertTabDropInfo) that makes it possible to 
    filter (accept/reject) all potential drops during a drag and 
    drop operation. The filters are set in the 
    DockingWindowDropFilterProperties in the DockingWindowProperties 
    for the DockingWindow. Per default, all drop types are accepted.
  
  - Added support for heavyweight components. This requires Java 
    1.5.0 and above. The heavyweight component must also support 
    reparenting i.e. be able to be added to/removed from/readded to 
    containers. The heayweight support is enabled by creating a 
    RootWindow with heavyweight support either via the RooWindow's 
    constructor or via DockingUtil.
    
  - Possibility to hide the entire tab area of a TabWindow when it only 
    contains a single window as a child window, see 
    TabWindowProperties.getTabbedPanelProperties().getTabAreaProperties()
    .setTabAreaVisiblePolicy(...).
  
  - New methods have been added to DockingWindowListener that make it 
    possible to listen to undock, dock, maximize, minimize and restore.
    There are also new listeners DockingWindowListener methods that allows 
    a listener to abort a minimize, maximize, restore, undock and dock 
    operation before it's performed.
  
  - Added actions: UndockAction, UndockWithAbortAction, DockAction 
    and DockWithAbortAction that undocks a window to a FloatingWindow 
    or docks the window back to the RootWindow. Also new actions for 
    minimize, maximize and restore with abort have been added.
    
  - All default button and menu items in the docking windows have been
    modified to use the new abortable window actions for minimize,
    maximize and restore.
    
  - Added property in WindowBarProperties that makes it possible to 
    enable/disable continuous layout for window bars content. When 
    disabled a resize drag indicator is shown. Added color property for 
    the drag indicator in WindowBarProperties.
  
  - Added color property in SplitWindowProperties for drag indicator 
    that is shown when continuous layout for a SplitWindow is disabled.
    
  - Added DeveloperUtil with utility/helper functions for IDW 
    developers. You can get the current layout in a RootWindow as a 
    String with pseudo-like Java code. You can also create a frame that 
    displays the current layout of  a window as pseudo-like Java code.
    Helpful when for example creating default layouts.
  
  - Added getDirection() to WindowBar that returns the bar's Direction 
    in the RootWindow.
  
  - A view now supports a title bar that shows the view's title and 
    icon. The bar also support a minimize, restore, dock, undock and 
    a close button. It's possible to add custom components to the 
    title bar by calling View.getCustomTitleBarComponents() and adding 
    components to the list. The title bar supports hovering and the 
    view can also be dragged via the title bar.
    
  - A dragged window can be dropped onto the title bar of a View and 
    it will be added as a tab to the TabWindow the View is a member of.
    
  - A new properties class called ViewTitleBarProperties has been 
    added. It contsins two ViewTitleBarStateProperties for normal 
    and focused state. It's  retreived from the ViewProperties in the 
    RootWindowProperties or from the ViewProperties for a View. It 
    contains functional and visual properties for the view title bar.
    
  - Added PropertiesUtil that contains utility functions for 
    manipulating properties. It has a function that modifies a 
    RootWindowsProperties object so that the views show title bars 
    and the tabs are oriented below the content area.
    
  - Scroll buttons and tab drop down list now have default tool tips.
  
  - Modified TabWindow's minimum size so that the entire content 
    area can be minimized when for example resizing a Splitwindow.

  - Added CloseOthersWindowAction which closes all tabs in an
    AbstractTabWindow except the one belonging to the window the
    action is performed upon. It is also added to the default
    popup menu.

  - Changes to button factory properties will now cause new buttons
    to be created.

  - All internal references to a view can now be removed using
    RootWindow.removeView(). This is useful if you have views that
    you want to remove permanently and don't want to be part of a
    serialized window layout. Note that only weak references
    to the views are stored in a RootWindow, so it's not necessary to
    call this method if you want to clear the references immediately.
    
  - The drag label now (per default) uses the same font and colors as 
    for the ooltip.
    
  - If the look and feel for the RootWindow changes, the RootWindow 
    will update the UI for all views added to the RootWindow. This 
    means that closed views that have not been removed from the 
    RootWindow will also be updated.


  Fixed bugs:
  
  - Fixed so that popup menu isn't shown when aborting dragging of 
    a TabWindow.

  - Fixed memory leaks that occured when creating and releasing a 
    RootWindow.

  - Fixed bug #1200629. Previously Swing timers was used internally 
    in IDW which caused the JVM to continue running when a JFrame 
    was disposed. These timers have been removed.
    
  - Fixed border bug around tab area components on window bar when 
    using SoftBlueIceDockingTheme



1.3.0 - 2005-02-16
------------------

  New features:

  - Added methods for preferred minimize direction. See
    DockingWindow.setPreferredMinimizeDirection() and
    DockingWindow.getPreferredMinimizeDirection(). 

  - Much improved window restore algorithm which should be able to
    restore most layouts correctly. Note that when restoring tab and
    split windows, the actual tab and split window is not restored,
    but rather the views inside it. See the developer's guide for
    more information.

  - When pressing the Shift key during a window drag and drop the
    tab will not be selected on drag and drop. This makes it
    possible to enable tab selection on mouse button press and
    still drag a tab into the selected tab in the same tabbed
    panel. Use RootWindowProperties.getTabWindowProperties().
    getTabbedPanelProperties().setTabSelectTrigger() to enable
    tab selection on mouse button press.

  - Made it easier to split a window inside a TabWindow by
    enlarging the split detection area for the inner window.
    Also increased RootWindowProperties.EDGE_SPLIT_DISTANCE to 6
    to simplify splitting.

  - Added the possibility of triggering window drags from
    the outside. See the net.infonode.docking.drag package and
    especially the DockingWindowDragSource class.

  - Added support for custom components in the tab area of an
    AbstractTabWindow. The components are shown between the scroll
    buttons and the close/minimize/restore buttons. See
    AbstractTabWindow.getCustomTabAreaComponents().

  - Added support for custom components in a view tab.
    The components are shown between the window title and the
    close/minimize/restore buttons. See
    View.getCustomTabComponents().

  - Added DockingWindowActionProvider's, see the
    net.infonode.docking.action package.

  - Added a property for the action performed when a docking
    window button is clicked, see
    WindowTabButtonProperty.ACTION_PROVIDER. Setting this property
    will overrride the default action, for example minimize.

  - WindowMenuUtil now displays icons in the popup menus. It uses
    action providers to get the icons.

  - Added support for adding mouse button listeners to a window tab.
    The listeners are called when a mouse button is pressed, clicked
    or released on the window tab. See
    DockingWindow.addTabMouseButtonListener() and
    DockingWindow.removeTabMouseButtonListener().

  - Added new methods to DockingWindowListener. Events are
    now generated when a window is added, removed, shown, hidden or
    when the view focus changes.

  - Added a DockingWindowTitleProvider interface which provides
    a title for a docking window. It can be set on a window using
    the DockingWindowProperties.TITLE_PROVIDER property. The
    SimpleDockingWindowTitleProvider is the title provider used
    for a window when there is no title provider in the window
    properties. LengthLimitedDockingWindowTitleProvider is a docking
    window title provider that provides a title that can be length
    limited.


  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed a bug that caused an indication that a window could be
    splitted with itself.

  - Fixed a bug that caused an exception in the popup menu
    factories created in WindowMenuUtil when triggering the popup menu
    on the root window and all views are added to the root window.

  - Fixed a bug that caused the window buttons to change appearance
    when using for example Skin Look and Feel. Now the buttons never
    change UI class.



1.2.0 - 2004-11-12
------------------

  - The commercial distribution is distributed under a slightly
    modified license, InfoNode Software License Version 1.1. The
    changes include a section about not being allowed to expose
    IDW functionality to external software components and
    a section that grants the licensee the right to obfuscate IDW
    together with a product.


  New features:

  - GradientDockingTheme is modified so that it uses the
    ComponentPainter instead of the border of the window area to
    paint the window area background.

  - Added two new theme classes: ClassicDockingTheme,
    SoftBlueIceDockingTheme and ShapedGradientDockingTheme. Both
    themes uses the new shaped tab functionality in ITP.

  - Added weak listener support for PropertyMap's. See
    net.infonode.properties.propertymap.PropertyMapWeakListenerManager
    for more information.

  - Added some window popup menu items for SplitWindow's, see
    WindowMenuUtil.createWindowMenuFactory.

  - Better window tree optimization handling.

  - Added a new SplitWindow property which can be used disable
    divider location dragging, see
    SplitWindowProperties.DIVIDER_LOCATION_DRAG_ENABLED.

  - Added a property DockingWindow.RESTORE_ENABLED which makes
    it possible to disable the restore operation for a window.
    Added method DockingWindow.isRestorable().

  - Added a property DockingWindow.CLOSE_ENABLED which makes
    it possible to disable the close operation for a window.
    Added method DockingWindow.isClosable().

  - Added a property DockingWindow.MAXIMIZE_ENABLED which makes
    it possible to disable the maximize operation for a window.
    Added method DockingWindow.isMaximizable().

  - Added a property DockingWindow.MINIMIZE_ENABLED which makes
    it possible to disable the minimize operation for a window. 

  - Added a property DockingWindow.DRAG_ENABLED which makes
    it possible to disable the mouse drag for a window.

  - Improved the window splitting when dragging a window. The empty
    space above the tabs in a TabWindow is now removed.

  - Added ShapedPanelProperties for the drag rectangle, see
    RootWindowProperties.DRAG_RECTANGLE_PROPERTIES.

  - Added ShapedPanelProperties for the window area, see
    RootWindowProperties.WINDOW_AREA_SHAPED_PANEL_PROPERTIES.

  - Added ShapedPanelProperties for the root window, see
    RootWindowProperties.SHAPED_PANEL_PROPERTIES.


  Fixed bugs:
  
  - Fixed a property bug which caused some listener to be garbage
    collected even when they could possibly be called. This caused the
    highlighted font to be of incorrect size in some themes.

  - Fixed minimum size for WindowBar content panel. 

  - If a window popup menu is empty it is not shown.

  - Fixed a bug which caused the window set with RootWindow.setWindow() 
    not to be immediately displayed on the screen.



1.1.0 - 2004-09-29
------------------
  
  - A small source code example application on how to use InfoNode 
    Docking Windows can be found in "examples/net/infonode/docking/example".  
    It is possible to compile and run the example.


  New features:

  - Docking windows can now be maximized to cover the entire root
    window (except window bars) and later restored to their
    previous location. See the DockingWindow.maximize() and
    DockingWindow.isMaximized() methods.

  - Buttons for minimize, close, restore and maximize has been
    added to the TabWindow. These buttons are customizable the
    same way as tab buttons are.

  - Added listener functionality to DockingWindow. This makes it
    possible to get callbacks before and after a window is closed.
    See DockingWindowListener and DockingWindow.addListener()
    for more information.

  - A new theme has been added, see GradientDockingTheme. This theme
    paints gradient tab backgrounds and supports an opaque title bar
    for TabWindow's, similar to the Eclipse tabbed windows.

  - Added two new methods in DockingWindow to show a window,
    makeVisible(), and request/restore focus for a window,
    restoreFocus().

  - Added a method DockingUtil.addWindow() which adds a window 
    inside a root window if it's not already there.

  - Added a class net.infonode.docking.util.StringViewMap which allows
    views to be identified by their title or another string. The
    DockingUtil class has been modified to support this view map.

  - The window tab buttons are now fully customizable through
    button factories. See the WindowTabButtonProperties.FACTORY
    property for more information.

  - A window now remembers the window bar where it was last located
    and is minimized to that window bar the next time.

  - Better focus handling to avoid flickering graphics and
    temporary focus owner changes when selecting tabs.

  - The window tab buttons tool tip text can now be modified. See
    the WindowTabButtonProperties.TOOL_TIP_TEXT property for more
    information.

  - A new property called "Continuous Layout Enabled" has been added
    to the split window properties. This property has the same effect
    as in a JSplitPane.
    
  - Closed views is written by the RootWindow.write() method
    of the last RootWindow they were located in.

  - Added removeSuperObject() methods to the property classes.
  
    
  Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed bug 1026492 which caused an IndexOutOfBoundsException
    when restoring a window to a tab window where tabs have been removed.

  - Fixed a bug which caused an exception when reading window layouts.
    This occured when the layout contained many views and property
    values.

  - Fixed a bug which caused windows to remain on window bars when
    reading a window layout. This could result in IOException being
    thrown.

  - Fixed a bug where the mouse hover highlight remained on buttons.

  - Fixed a bug in PropertyMap which caused parent super maps to be
    added in incorrect order.
